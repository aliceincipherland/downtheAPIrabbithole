# down the API rabbithole
These are projects done for the educational purpose of becoming more familiar with the windows API and interacting with the native API, system calls and DLLs. In this walk-through, I was able to create a simple DLL injection using various window API calling functions all through the c-types library in Python, as I yet have to master C as a language, which is traditionally the language used to developed these scripts. This script and the associated DLL are relatively rudimentary, but they demonstrate an important concept which can be leveraged for hard-to-detect attacks. This can evade basic anti-virus software's which user user-hooking to identify illegitimate processes and using the legitimate process to obfuscate the execution of the DLL. One of the best defense against DLL injection is digital signature verification and maintain an allow-list of trusted folders with DLLs. 

In the next project, I hope to create a script which then alerts on the API calls, CreateRemoteThread and WriteProcessMemory, while also verifying the signature of the DLL to help mitigate this attack to further reduce false positives.
